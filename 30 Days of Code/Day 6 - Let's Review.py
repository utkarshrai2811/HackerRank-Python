Objective
Today we're expanding our knowledge of Strings and combining it with what we've already learned about loops.
Task
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1,
print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters
as 2 space-separated strings on a single line.
Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.
